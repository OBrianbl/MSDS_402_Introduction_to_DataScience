## Problem Description
The widget company already collects data from a number of source systems, including sales volume, 
production costs, total number of customers, number of new customers, and total market sales 
(sales from Widget co. and its competitors).<br>

Collected data on customer satisfaction, including their overall satisfaction, the likelihood
they will purchase widgets again, the likelihood they will recommend widgets to others, 
and their satisfaction with the quality, design, and price of the widgets.<br>

that will informs supervisors about the status of widget sales. The dashboard 
includes at least four metrics or key performance indicators.<br>
