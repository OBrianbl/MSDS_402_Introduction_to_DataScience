# Team Survye Design and Implementation Project

* Design a sampling plan appropriate to the population of interest and to the research question or hypothesis. 
How do you intend to obtain an adequate sample size? How do you plan to obtain a sample that is representative of the population, 
so that you can make generalizing statements about the population? Describe your method for defining the sampling frame (this will be "listable"). 
What type of sampling method(s) will be used? What methods (medium) will be employed to obtain survey responses? How many times will respondents 
be asked to participate? What about incentives? Is a panel being utilized? Will respondents be given the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of the survey? 
Provide justification or rationale for your choices.<br>

* Design a survey instrument appropriate for the selected mode of delivery. Prepare the actual survey instrument, drawing on the work of others
 (this means you will research literature on your topic, and look for relevant questionnaires or survey questions used by others). 
 Questions should be well crafted, be in appropriate form, and provide adequate information to answer the research question you have posed. 
 Ensure that the form of the survey makes sense and that the survey questions are written in clear and unambiguous language.
 Ensure that the survey covers the domain of interest, but is not too long. If it exceeds five minutes in length, provide a rationale for why.
 If it exceeds 15 minutes in length, provide an explanation about incentives for respondent participation.<br>

* Ensure that the measures obtained with survey designed provides the data needed to address the research question/hypothesis, which seeks to anser the following:
..* How will the survey data be analyzed? What methods will you use to address the research question or hypothesis? 
..* Address the impact of poor quality data on the ability to answer research questions. Describe how you will handle missing data.

* Finished product is a six page paper, double spaced, in correct APA style. (The survey instrument itself is provided in 
an appendix)
